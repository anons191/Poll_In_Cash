**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Merrell Acosta  
**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Status:** MVP Scope Approved

## 1. Overview

**Poll in Cash** is a decentralized polling platform that rewards verified users in **USDC on Base** for completing polls.  
It connects **poll creators**, **participants**, and **data buyers** through a trustless system using **smart contracts (Thirdweb)**, **Worldcoin for ID verification**, and **Firebase** for off-chain data handling.

### Mission
Empower users to monetize their opinions while ensuring data integrity, verified participation, and instant crypto payouts.

### Core Principles
- **Proof of Personhood**: Every participant verified via Worldcoin World ID.
- **Instant Rewards**: Smart contract disburses rewards immediately upon completion.
- **No PII Storage**: Personal info never stored in our database.
- **Fair Compensation**: Transparent reward logic, 10% platform fee.
- **Scalable + Trustless**: Thirdweb on Base handles all payouts and escrow.
