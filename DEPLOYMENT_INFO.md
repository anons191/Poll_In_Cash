## Git Integration

Deployments appear to be working. To verify Git auto-deployment:

1. **Check Git Connection**: Visit https://vercel.com/merrell-acostas-projects/poll-in-cash/settings/git
   - If connected, you'll see your GitHub repository listed
   - Future pushes to `main` will auto-deploy

2. **Test Auto-Deployment**: Make a small change and push:
   ```bash
   # Make a small change (e.g., update README)
   echo "# Test deployment" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Test: Trigger Vercel auto-deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```
   
   If Git is connected, Vercel will automatically deploy within 1-2 minutes.

```bash
vercel --prod
